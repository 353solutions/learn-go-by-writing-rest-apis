## Chapters

* In [Setup][setup] we'll make sure you have all the prerequisites
* We'll write the customary ["Hello World" program][hello-world]
    - Program structure, import path, types
* Now we can add some [tests][tests]
    - Testing, declarations, `if` statement
* Next we'll add [ping & time][ping] handlers
    - HTTP protocol, REST overview
* After that we'll [set and get keys][setget]
    - map, slicing, byte arrays, defer
* Then we'll return all the [keys][keys]
    - slices, `for` loop, empty interface, JSON
* We'll use [gorilla/mux][mux] to simplify routing
    - `go get`
* Finally support [concurrency][chan] next
    - goroutines, channels
